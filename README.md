## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher.  
- OpenAI API Key (get yours from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)).  
- Required Python Libraries: `openai`, `dotenv`.

### 🔧 Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AyushTiwari25/MEDULLA.AI.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd MEDULLA.AI

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 🗝️ Step 1: Load the API Key and Libraries

```python
import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

# Load the API key securely
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

### 🤖 Step 2: Define the AI Completion Function

```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0,  # Adjust for creative randomness
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

### 📝 Step 3: Generate AI Responses

```python
# Example prompt
prompt = "Explain the significance of AI in modern industries."
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:  
> "AI revolutionizes industries by enhancing efficiency, enabling predictive analytics, and fostering innovation across sectors such as healthcare, finance, and education."
